# Odin Recipes

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/about) curriculum to practice the basic HTML elements and creating a structured website with a few webpages.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to create webpages linked with each other that contains basic HTML elements in its bodies.

## How I Did It
For the homepage, I have created an unordered list that contains the links to the webpages for each recipe.

For each recipe page, there are three different sections, namely:
- Description
- Ingredients, and
- Steps

Each section has the appropriate heading element at the top.

Included in each page is an image of the dish being described.

Lastly, at the end of each webpage is the link to the source of the recipe -- where I got the recipe from, and another link back to the homepage.
