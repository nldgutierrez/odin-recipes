    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Spaghetti bolognese</strong> consists of spaghetti (long strings of pasta) with an Italian <i>ragù</i> (meat sauce) made with minced beef, bacon and tomatoes, served with Parmesan cheese. Spaghetti bolognese is one of the most popular pasta dishes eaten outside of Italy.</p>
    <h3>What is spaghetti bolognese?</h3>
    <p>Spaghetti bolognese (<i>spaghetti alla bolognese</i> in Italian, pronounced: “spa-GET-tie alla bolo-NYEH-seh") is a main course consisting of spaghetti (long thin strings of pasta) with a bolognese sauce over it.</p>
    <p>It is a corrupted version of the traditional <i>ragù alla Bolognese</i>: pasta with a meat sauce as they make it in the city of Bologna. But calling spaghetti bolognese an Italian dish would be a step too far, and many Italians would be disappointed with the description.</p>
    <p>This is because, in Italy, there are many types of <i>ragù</i>, including the one from Bologna. Bolognese sauce should only ever be served with fresh <i>tagliatelle</i>, <i>tortellini</i> or <i>lasagne</i>; never with spaghetti as the sauce is thick and contains pieces, so it will not satisfactorily cling to thin, delicate strings. According to the average Italian, <em>a firm sauce needs firm pasta</em> - it's as simple as that.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a large saucepan on a medium heat and add 1 tbsp olive oil.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add 4 finely chopped bacon rashers and fry for 10 mins until golden and crisp.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Reduce the heat and add the 2 onions, 2 carrots, 2 celery sticks, 2 garlic cloves and the leaves from 2-3 sprigs rosemary, all finely chopped, then fry for 10 mins. Stir the veg often until it softens.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Increase the heat to medium-high, add 500g beef mince and cook stirring for 3-4 mins until the meat is browned all over.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add 2 tins plum tomatoes, the finely chopped leaves from ¾ small pack basil, 1 tsp dried oregano, 2 bay leaves, 2 tbsp tomato purée, 1 beef stock cube, 1 deseeded and finely chopped red chilli (if using), 125ml red wine and 6 halved cherry tomatoes.

        <br>
        <li>Drain the spaghetti and either stir into the bolognese sauce, or serve the sauce on top. Serve with more grated parmesan, the remaining basil leaves and crusty bread, if you like.</li>
